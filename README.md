Sample code for the Go Programming Language

Introduction
============
As I learn about the Go Programming Language I will create sample programs to illustrate what I have learned. I don't claim any of this is useful or even golang idomatic.  But, I have to start somewhere.

Note these files are apache2 license.  

Use at your own risk. I'm just learning.  Most of these are probably not idiomatic golang examples.
